Fix pack â€” Routes restore + tester pages
Generated: 2025-08-11T03:37:08.487834

What this does
- Restores your original Routes.php (backed up as BACKUP/Routes.php.original_backup in this zip) and appends tester routes safely, outside adminauth.
- Adds two tester pages (Classic + Android) under AdminLTE/Bootstrap-like simple layout.
- Uses ?key=arvindrchauhan1723 for access; no admin login needed.

Install
1) Unzip at project root. It will place a merged app/Config/Routes.php.
   Your original (from what you uploaded here) is saved at BACKUP/Routes.php.original_backup inside this zip.
2) Ensure these files exist after upload:
   - app/Controllers/Admin/Tools/ApiTesterClassic.php
   - app/Controllers/Admin/Tools/ApiTesterAndroid.php
   - app/Views/admin/tools/api_tester_classic.php
   - app/Views/admin/tools/api_tester_android.php
3) Test:
   /index.php/admin/tools/api-tester-classic?key=arvindrchauhan1723
   /index.php/admin/tools/api-tester-android?key=arvindrchauhan1723

Notes
- This pack does not change your API auth or other routes. It only appends the tester routes.
- If your live Routes.php differs from the one you uploaded, send me that file and I will re-merge.
